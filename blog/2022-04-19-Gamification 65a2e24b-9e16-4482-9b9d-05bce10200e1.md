# Gamification

Perhaps the best way to introduce the notion of gamification is by breaking the stereotype: 

> Gamification is not about making games → It’s about designing the right mechanism that help users gain values.    

What is the elements in the game that makes people voluntary engaging with it? Can we bring that to our design of products so user are motivated to use them? 

That’s the right way to view gamification.
