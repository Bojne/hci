**Designing Layout** covers basic things you need to think about when creating or evaluating objects. 

### Goals 👀

> “Great design should pursue easy of use and craft” - Julia Zhao  

According to [Prof. Scott Klemmer](https://youtu.be/TIg8ab4PqbU) of UC San Diego, the goals of design are: 

* `Guide`: Convey structure, relative importance, relationships 

* `Pace`: Draw people in, help orient, provide hooks to dive deep 

* `Message`: Express meaning and style breath life into content.

Examples of Google Chrome  

If we applied the goal of the design, we see: 

* `Guide`: The central title is shown large size, guide the important of the page.

* `Pace`: The "Download Chrome” button have is a call-to-action, in blue color and button style. 

* `Message`: The message here is a browser build by the world’s top search engine company. The page use copy and google logo to show it.
