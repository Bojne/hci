# Assistive Technology 

The question that `Assistive Technology` tries to address is 

> How to design computer that help people reach higher potentials? 

It’s a based on the core belief that technology should follow human centered design. The vision is that technology should create utopia, and not a dystopia. 

### How to we get started on this topic? 

Bret Victor offers a great opinion on a meta-level of how human can interact with the medium in creative ways

> "Media for Thinking the Unthinkable" available [here](http://worrydream.com/MediaForThinkingTheUnthinkable/)

The core idea is that, we should be visionary about how we can leverage the medium and design for interactions.   

For example, understanding circuit design is difficult due to its abstraction. But if we design software to show the complex interaction, then we are able to think more. 

### Examples 

Bret proposed the idea in 2013, when interface design was far from mature compared to today. Yet, his idea was so fundamental that we can still see the application today. 

* [Runway](https://runwayml.com/) let people have powerful video editing skills 

* [Figma](https://figma.com/) let people create design through auto-layout and community driven shared components 

* [Brilliant](https://brilliant.org/) let people learn math and science concepts with interactive interface.  

### Case Study: Computer and Creativity 

[Molly Mielke](https://www.mollymielke.com/) wrote her [thesis of Computer and Creativity](https://www.mollymielke.com/cc). She inspect the computer history and then proposed the following question: 

> **How can digital co-creation tools augment human creativity and collaboration?**

Her answers is three qualities for such a tool: 

* `Standardization`: the tools provide use familiar ways to operate them 

* `Moldability`: the tools can adopt to user’s need and be customized 

* `Abstraction`: the tool focus on the most meaningful part of creation, and take care of the nitty gritty part that’s irrelevant to the glad 

### Aspirations 

We think the following field will be critical to the assistive technology landscape:

* `Machine Intelligence`, that would collaborate and speed up human creation process  

* `Virtual Reality`, that gives a new medium for a whole new set of interactions  

* `Developer Tools`, that make it easier for people to leverage the power of computer.
